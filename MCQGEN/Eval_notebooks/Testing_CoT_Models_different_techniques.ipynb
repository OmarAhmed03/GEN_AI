            "## Understanding the Inner Workings of AI\n",
            "\n",
            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses various techniques for building intelligent machines. It's not a single thing, but rather a collection of approaches, tools, and algorithms designed to mimic human intelligence.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Here's a simplified breakdown of how AI works:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Data is King:** AI systems are trained on massive datasets, which act as the learning material. These datasets can contain images, text, sound, or other data depending on the task.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Algorithms: The Brains of the Operation:** AI systems use different algorithms to analyze the data and learn patterns. Some common algorithms include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Machine Learning:** These algorithms learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.\n",
            "* **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.\n",
            "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand and process human language.\n",
            "* **Computer Vision:** Allows computers to \"see\" and interpret images.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Learning and Adaptation:**  Through training, AI systems identify patterns and correlations within the data, allowing them to adapt and improve their performance over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Making Predictions and Decisions:**  Once trained, AI systems can make predictions or decisions based on new data inputs, mimicking human reasoning and decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "**A Simple Analogy:** Imagine teaching a child to recognize different fruits. You show them pictures of apples, oranges, and bananas, pointing out their unique features. Over time, the child learns to identify fruits based on their shape, color, and texture. \n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, AI systems learn from large amounts of data, identifying patterns and correlations to make predictions or decisions. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Types of AI:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Narrow AI:** Designed to perform specific tasks, like image recognition or language translation. This is the most common type of AI.\n",
            "* **General AI:** Aims to create machines that can learn and perform any intellectual task a human can. Still a work in progress.\n",
            "* **Super AI:** Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every aspect.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Applications of AI:**\n",
            "\n",
            "AI is being used in various fields, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Healthcare:** Diagnosing diseases, developing new treatments, and personalizing care plans.\n",
            "* **Finance:** Detecting fraud, providing personalized financial advice, and automating trading.\n",
            "* **Transportation:** Developing self-driving cars, optimizing traffic flow, and improving logistics.\n",
            "* **Entertainment:** Creating realistic video games, generating music, and personalizing entertainment recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Data Bias:** AI systems can perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on.\n",
            "* **Job Displacement:** AI automation might lead to job losses in some industries.\n",
            "* **Ethical Concerns:** AI raises ethical questions regarding privacy, responsibility, and potential misuse.\n",
            "\n",
            "**AI is a rapidly evolving field with tremendous potential. Understanding its core principles and applications is crucial for navigating this transformative technology.**\n",

            "The number of questions should be enough to cover the main topics, but not so many that the exam becomes too long or overwhelming. A typical high school exam might last 1-2 hours. Assuming students spend an average of 5 minutes per question, this would allow for 12-24 questions. However, long answer questions may take longer, so I will aim for around 15-20 questions in total. This should provide a good balance between breadth and depth. My certainty level for this step is moderate, as the ideal number of questions can depend on the specific content and difficulty of the questions.\n",

            "Step 6: Step 5: Creating the Questions\n",
            "Now that I have determined the topics, format, and number of questions, I can start creating the questions. I will aim for a mix of difficulty levels, with some questions that most students should be able to answer correctly and some that are more challenging. I will also try to cover a range of sub-topics within each main topic. For example, within derivatives, I might include questions on the power rule, the product rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. My certainty level for this step is high, as I can draw on a large database of calculus problems to create the questions.\n",

If the user is interacting with a software application, 'quit' might be a command to close the application. If the user is in the middle of a task or process, 'quit' could be a command to stop that process. If the user is discussing a habit or behavior, 'quit' could be a decision to stop that behavior. However, without more information, I can't determine which interpretation is correct. As an AI, I can only make educated guesses based on the information provided.\n",

I can't infer the user's mood, tone, or context from a single word. I also can't ask follow-up questions to clarify the user's intention. These limitations make it difficult to provide a meaningful response to the user's input. It's important to remember that AI is a tool that can assist with tasks and provide information, but it's not a substitute for human understanding and empathy.\n",

        "6. **Question Type**: Classify the type of question (e.g., Conceptual, Calculation, Application, Word Problem).\n",
        "7. **Educational Objective**: Briefly describe the learning objective this question aims to assess (e.g., “Test understanding of the relationship between complementary angles.”).\n",
